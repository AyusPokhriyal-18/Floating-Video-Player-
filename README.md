# Floating-Video-Player-
An augmented reality app. Made by using ArCore and sceneform. In this, I build the 3d model renderable class in order to get the 3d model that will help to render the video.Then, linked the source of that object to the video screen file.At last, set the media player on the top of external texture filter chromatic light.
